Sandbox
=======

Sandbox provides facilities for learning and experimenting with Python,
and for creating and editing Python files.

It is designed to be easy to learn and use, and to provide a PyQt-based
alternative to IDLE. (If you need a full-featured IDE, with support for
debugging, we suggest you use eric4
(http://www.die-offenbachs.de/eric/index.html)

Sandbox requires Python 2.5 and PyQt 4.2 (or later versions).

Installation is easy since Sandbox is supplied as a single Python file.
On Unix-like systems you may need to set sandbox.pyw to have execute
permission and to put it (or a soft-link to it) in your PATH. For
Windows, double-click to start it. You can always create a convenient
shortcut to it if you find yourself using it quite often.

Sandbox's home page is http://www.qtrac.eu/sandbox.html.
