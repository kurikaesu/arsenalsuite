2009/10/23 12:48:37  phil
Fixed a problem deleting slot proxies when the interpreter has been finalised
but Qt is still tidying up.


2009/10/23 11:45:42  phil
Fixed the detection of the phonon module in Qt v4.5.3 (which only seems to be
a problem on Windows).


2009/10/20 11:58:07  phil
Hopefully finally fixed the regression where slot proxies were being deleted
too soon when disconnect() was called from within the slot.  (With much help
from Hans-Peter Jansen.)


2009/10/14 16:19:06  phil
Eliminated the compiler warning messages related to qDebug() and friends.
A number of private copy ctors added manually (and temporarily) to allow
building against Qt v4.6.0-beta1.


2009/10/13  8:44:03  phil
Fixed a pyuic bug with QHeaderView.setSortIndicatorShown().


2009/10/10 12:20:10  phil
Added the QMacCocoaViewContainer class.


2009/10/10 10:38:50  phil
Updated sandbox from Mark Summerfield.


2009/10/09 19:53:50  phil
Fixed a premature delete that affected QTimer.singleShot().


2009/10/09  6:14:41  phil
Reverted the /Constrained/ annotation on QClipboard.text() for the QString v1
API as a mutable QString is only needed if the initial value is null.
Therefore allowing an ordinary string won't lose information.


2009/10/07 22:37:06  phil
Added the missing QGraphicsSceneDragDropEvent.setDropAction().


2009/10/07 18:05:59  phil

Fixed a typo in the API selection documentation.


2009/10/07 14:44:28  phil
Added a missing /Transfer/ from QFileDialog.setProxyModel().


2009/10/02  9:43:58  phil
Switched to Qt v4.5.3.


2009/10/01 22:31:45  phil
Added more includes of QHash.

loading .ui files with loadUi().


2009/09/18 18:22:08  phil
Added a missing cast (needed by MinGW) to the QString conversion code.


2009/09/18  9:36:13  phil
Added widthChar() and boundingRectChar() to QFontMetrics and QFontMetricsF for
v2 of the QString API.  These are needed because width() and boundingRect()
give different results for a QChar and a QString of length one.


2009/09/17 22:06:02  phil
Made the width() and boundingRect() QChar overloads specific to v2 of the
QString API.


2009/09/17 19:13:22  phil
Reenabled the QChar overloads of the width() and boundingRect() methods of
QFontMetrics and QFontMetricsF as they are not the equivalent of a single
character QString.


2009/09/17  9:40:03  phil
Invalid keyword arguments to a QObject ctor now raise an exception (as they do
with pyqtConfigure()).


2009/09/16 15:06:38  phil
Documented the additional QVariant incompatibility that it no longer keeps a
reference to QObject instances.


2009/09/14 12:12:49  phil
Further fixes for Snow Leopard on 64 bit systems.
Added QObject.pyqtConfigure().


2009/09/12 17:39:10  phil
Fixed pyuic4 for the minimum width and height for columns and rows, and column
and row spacing.


2009/09/12 13:28:05  phil
configure.py no longer assumes that an explicit architecture means a universal
binary.


2009/09/12  3:10:03  phil
Added the --use-arch command line option to configure to force MacOS python to
use a particular architecture.

2009/09/02 20:33:00  phil
Added the /Array/ and /ArraySize/ annotations to the drawLines(),
drawPoints(), drawPolygon() and drawRects() methods of QPaintEngine (although
SIP doesn't support them yet).


2009/08/23 12:56:29  phil
Fixed the line numbers in .ts files.


2009/08/21 18:52:28  phil
Fixed pylupdate's broken handling of Python comments.


2009/08/21 14:57:40  phil
Added a missing /Transfer/ to QSyntaxHighlighter.setCurrentBlockUserData().


2009/08/19  8:00:42  phil
Fixed the QString buffer protocol implementation for Python v2.x built with
UCS4 support.


2009/08/18 16:50:37  phil
Added a missing /Transfer/ to QTreeWidget.setItemWidget().


2009/08/18 16:33:29  phil
pyuic now uses the Python implementation of ElementTree so that it handles
XML provided in a StringIO.


2009/08/11 14:34:17  phil
Fixed QGraphicsLinearLayout.removeAt() as Qt doesn't always return ownership
to the caller as the documentation claims.


2009/08/11 13:41:52  phil
Removed the remaining calls to deleteLater() in the slot/signal proxy code.


2009/08/11 12:16:24  phil
Fixed a similar regression.


2009/08/11 11:48:03  phil
Fixed a regression introduced when getting the QVariant v2 API working with Qt
registered meta-types.


2009/08/11 11:36:22  phil
Signal/slot proxies are now deleted as soon as possible to reduce the use of
deleteLater().


2009/08/10 19:34:15  phil
Minor improvements to the storing of proxy slot objects.


2009/08/09 22:29:12  phil
QAbstractFileEngine, QTextDecoder, QTextEncoder and QSqlResult now have
sip.wrapper as their super-type as they all can be returned by virtual
factories which use the object ownership infrastructure.


2009/08/08 21:41:19  phil
Use memcpy() instead of Py_UNICODE_COPY() because Py_MEMCPY() is broken on
Windows with C++.


2009/08/08 18:43:11  phil
Updated the demos examples for the QString v2 API.


2009/08/08 18:20:03  phil

Fixed the conversions between QString and Unicode objects for code points
greater than 0xffff when Python is built with --enable-unicode=ucs4.


2009/08/05 19:26:45  phil

QDoubleValidator, QIntValidator, QRegExpValidator, QSpinBox and QValidator for
v2 of the QString API.


2009/08/04 14:28:35  phil
Fixed the fixup() methods of QAbstractSpinBox, QDateTimeEdit, QDoubleSpinBox,
QSpinBox and QValidator for v2 of the QString API.


2009/08/04 13:03:07  phil
Fixed QClipboard for the QString v2 API.


2009/08/04 12:43:48  phil
Added the getOpenFileNameAndFilter(), getOpenFileNamesAndFilter() and
getSaveFileNameAndFilter() static methods to QFileDialog.
The getOpenFileName(), getOpenFileNames() and getSaveFileName() static methods
of QFileDialog don't take a mutable QString argument to return the selected
filter for v2 of the QString API.


2009/08/04  0:28:01  phil
Fixed QWebPage.javaScriptPrompt() for the v2 QString API.


2009/08/03 16:14:36  phil
Fixed QTextStream for v2 of the QString API.


2009/08/03 15:05:21  phil

2009/08/02 21:31:45  phil
qt_set_sequence_auto_mnemonic() is now OS/X specific.


2009/08/02 21:09:50  phil
v2 of the QString API now converts between a null QString and None.


2009/08/02 19:02:18  phil
Removed overloads of QXmlQuery.evaluateTo() that take pointers to QStringList
and QString as they won't work with the v2 QString API.  If anybody notices we
can implement something with handwritten code.


2009/08/02 18:16:33  phil
Added the v2 implementation of QStringList.


2009/08/02 16:20:16  phil
Removed the qwt.py plugin for pyuic as one is now included with PyQwt.


2009/08/02 15:39:24  phil
A QLatin1String can now be passed whenever a QString is expected.
Removed all overloads that took a QLatin1String where there is an equivalent
that takes a QString (ie. all of them).
Removed QLatin1String from the v2 QString API.


2009/08/02 14:47:58  phil
Removed QLatin1Char from the QString v2 API.


2009/08/02 14:28:29  phil
Added the v2 API support for QChar.
Removed the fromUnicode() and convertFromUnicode() methods that take an array
of QChar from QTextCodec.  This means an incompatibility as QTextCodec is now
abstract and cannot be sub-classed - but doing so before would never have
worked anyway.


2009/08/02 13:45:07  phil
Removed the width() and boundingRect() methods of QFontMetrics and
QFontMetricsF that take QChar arguments as they can be handled by the
overloads that take a QString.

Removed QStringMatcher from v2 of the QString API.


2009/08/01 22:03:55  phil

Added missing /Transfer/ annotations to QBoxLayout.addSpacerItem() and
QBoxLayout.insertSpacerItem().


2009/07/27 19:03:52  phil
Fixed the super-class for QGLContext as it takes part in parent/child
relationships.


2009/07/24 17:27:18  phil
Fixed the highlightedtextedit.py example.
configure.py gives precedence to the directory containing sip.h to that
containing Python.h (as the latter may include a distro supplied sip.h).


2009/07/20 11:39:23  phil
QVariant.toPyObject() now recurses through any collections.


2009/07/17 13:57:55  phil

tablemodel.py examples to the QVariant v2 API.


2009/07/07 18:14:54  phil
Added the static functions to the QVariant v2 API.


2009/07/07 10:56:13  phil
Applied the new /AllowNone/ annotation to the v1 implementation of QVariant.
Changed fetchmore.py, simpledommodel.py and simpletreemodel.py as they are now
independent of the QVariant API.


2009/07/06 20:03:32  phil
Converted the application.py, mdi.py, recentfiles.py and sdi.py examples to
the QVariant v2 API.


2009/07/06 19:42:26  phil

Implemented the different __hash__ APIs.


2009/06/17 11:58:30  phil
Added the %API directive defaulting to v2 for Python3 and v1 for Python2.
SIP v4.9 is now required.

2009/06/16  9:21:01  phil
Only convert exact dicts to a QVariantMap and back and not dict sub-classes.


2009/06/14 14:57:37  phil
Removed an assertion when building dynamic meta-objects, instead just ignore
the attribute if it doesn't have the expected type.


2009/06/13 11:29:17  phil
Fixed the handling of QWizard by pyuic.


2009/06/12 17:28:44  phil
Changed the SIP dependency to v4.8.1 (not necessary but we don't want it to
survive in the wild).
Changed the roadmap to show how incompatible APIs will be selected.


2009/06/12  9:09:41  phil
Fixed __str__ for QByteArray for Python v3 so it is consistent with Python v2.


2009/06/12  8:23:23  phil
Reverted the roadmap change about __hash__ being an incompatibile change.  The
issue isn't that the hash function has changed (which isn't considered a
compatibility problem) it's that different objects that previously had a
different hash value (based on their id()) now might have the same hash value.


2009/06/11 22:16:19  phil
Updated the roadmap to show that the __hash__ additions (including QUrl) are
not now considered incompatible changes.


2009/06/11 14:20:11  phil
Removed the Python v3 buffer protocol support for QString.

Added the missing setCoordinateMode() and coordinateMode() methods from
QGradient.


2009/06/05  9:40:16  phil
Released as v4.5.


2009/06/04 22:36:11  phil
Another (final) go at fixing QAbstractItemModel.createIndex().


2009/06/04 21:38:38  phil
Changed the implementation of QModelIndex.internalId() to match that of the
id() builtin - and let Python handle the portabilty issues.


2009/06/04 18:05:02  phil
Removed the /KeepReference/ annotation from QAbstractItemModel.createIndex()
as the extra reference should really be associated with the returned
QModelIndex.


2009/06/04 14:53:46  phil
Hopefully finally fixed QModel.internalId() and
QAbstractItemModel.createIndex() for all platforms.


2009/06/03 22:29:54  phil
Treat QModelIndex.internalId() and a quint64 rather than qint64.


2009/06/03 17:12:23  phil
Use the Qt v4.2.0 and later version of QAbstractItemModel.createIndex().


2009/06/01 14:31:16  phil
Backed out QFlags.testFlag() because of some problem with PyKDE4 (and no time
to investigate further).


2009/06/01 10:17:36  phil
QVector<unsigned> now creates Python long objects to ensure values stay
unsigned on 32 bit systems.


2009/05/29 16:04:00  phil
Eliminated more warning messages.


2009/05/29 12:56:59  phil

Added the graphicssystems plugins to the Windows installer.


2009/05/27 13:25:58  phil

Added support for QVariantHash - that completes the updates for Qt v4.5.


2009/03/08 17:26:14  phil
Backed out the support for decorating __init__ with pyqtSlot.  The way that
support for QMetaObject::newInstance() has been implemented is broken as there

data is lost.


2009/02/22 19:04:36  phil
Completed the implementation of pyqtSignal.
Fixed the signature strings so that they will be correct for connecting
signals.  (Has this changed the QVariant conversion behaviour?)

Added the stub of the pyqtBoundSignal type.
pyqtSignal will now act as a descriptor and will create pyqtBoundSignal
instances when required.

The documentation generator now adds a paragraph for default signal overloads.
Changed the order of signals as necessary to ensure the default is sensible.

2009/02/12 18:43:51  phil
The results of parsing a list of argument types is now cached.


2009/02/11 23:12:55  phil
Changed Chimera to take the flag flag from the Pyt4-specific type structure.

Added the QInputContextFactory class.


2009/01/27 11:35:40  phil
Changed the handling of QVariantList and QVariantMap so that they are only used
if the values are explicitly QVariants - Chimera no longer automatically
creates QVariants as necessary.  This is because:

- explicit QVariants were being wrapped inside Chimera-created QVariants
  causing surprising results when it was reversed

- more consistent (but not exactly the same) as existing behaviour

- the conversions now go through what will become version dependent APIs, ie.
  no changes should be needed when the QVariant v2 API is introduced.

There are some changes in behaviour, ie. the type() of the QVariant may be
different in some cases.

Use pyqt4TypeDef instead of sipTypeDef.


2008/12/19 19:15:46  phil
Defined the pyqtWrapperType meta-type as a sub-class of sipWrapper type that
contains the dynamic meta-object for for QObject dereived classes.


2008/12/19 17:20:24  phil
Changed the QObject helpers to use sipTypeDefs rather than sipWrapperTypes.


2008/12/19 11:02:12  phil

Migrated from sipGetWrapper() to sipGetPyObject().


2008/12/13 18:02:57  phil
More moves from sipClass_* to sipType_*.

Fixed bugs in handwritten code related to sip.simplewrapper.


2008/12/06 15:40:40  phil

Updates to the installers.


2008/10/31 23:51:44  phil
Changed all uses of sequences to explicitly use PySequence_Check() as
PySequence_Size() returning a valid value may not be sufficient (eg. sets).


2008/10/29 20:59:29  phil
PyQt should now compile against Stackless.
More fixes for the GPL installer related to setting PATH and non-admin
installs.


2008/10/26 17:05:00  phil

may work better with non-administrator installs.


2008/10/26 13:03:03  phil
Fixed a pyuic bug caused by a widget being called "_name" in the .ui file.


2008/10/26 11:10:46  phil
The configuration of the Designer plugin now uses exec_prefix rather than
prefix.
Added the --no-designer-plugin option to configure.py.

Fixed a bug in pyqtProperty() where the name of the setter wasn't being
properly checked to see if it follows the Designer naming standard.


2008/10/22 17:53:38  phil
Added a missing /Constrained/ from the first QVariant ctor needed by the new
SIP enum handling.


2008/10/20 10:27:13  phil
Fixed a bug in pyuic's handling of QFormLayout when a layout is being set in a
role rather than a widget.

Completed the roadmap.


2008/10/17 19:26:15  phil
Added the missing Windows and Mac versions from QSysInfo.
Added more to the roadmap.

Added the /Constrained/ enum annotations required by the latest SIP.


2008/10/12 13:07:00  phil
More changes to QVariant to further minimise the changes from previous
versions.


2008/10/11 21:23:06  phil

2008/10/07 23:51:08  phil
Added support for qreal being implemented as either a float or a double.


2008/10/07  6:42:50  phil
QSizeGrip support is now determined by configure.py.


2008/10/05 14:46:00  phil
Fixed QDesktopServices.setUrlHandler() so that it works the same as the C++
implementation but also accepts a method that is a slot of a QObject.


2008/10/05 11:55:35  phil
Backed out the explicit support for the QList<QVariant> and
QMap<QString, QVariant> mapped types as they break backwards compatibility.


2008/10/02 10:45:47  phil
Fixed a pyuic bug handling empty icon sets.


2008/10/01 12:04:58  phil
Added the unit tests for QVariant.


2008/09/28 23:30:16  phil
Added the unit tests for __pyqtSignals__ and pyqtSignature().


2008/09/27 22:25:20  phil
Added the unit tests for pyqtProperty.
Python integer objects will now be stored as int types in QVariant where
possible (rather than qlonglong) so that enums are stored as ints.


2008/09/26  8:42:26  phil
Added data() (returning a void *) to QXmlAttributes, QPolygon and QPolygonF.


2008/09/25 18:39:10  phil
Updated the unit test framework and started to add the ad-hoc tests to it.


2008/09/21 13:00:08  phil
Updated the docs relating to QVariant and Python objects.
Removed the QMetaType.type() overload as it is now completely broken.  Strictly
speaking this breaks backwards compatibility but it was present for such a
short period of time that nobody should miss it.


2008/09/18 23:19:36  phil
Updates to the GPL installer for Python v2.6.


2008/09/18 19:57:14  phil
Switched the internal build system to Qt v4.4.2.


2008/09/16 22:59:52  phil
No, it should have been SIP v4.7.8 that is now required.


2008/09/16 18:45:51  phil
SIP v4.7.7 is now required.
The QVariant support will now use the correct C++ type name when seeing if it
is aleady registered.


2008/09/15 20:41:05  phil
Removed a compiler warning message with Python v2.6rc1.
pyuic4 uses the set builtin rather than the sets module where possible to avoid
deprecation warnings with Python v2.6rc1.


2008/09/15 19:46:27  phil
Added the missing sub-class convertor code that handles QGraphicsScene events.


2008/09/11 22:31:07  phil
Implemented the enhanced support for converting QVariants back to Python
objects - but completely untested.


2008/09/11 21:25:05  phil
Further changes when creating a QVariant.  Converting back to a Python object
is still broken.


2008/09/08 10:47:07  phil
Reimplemented the conversions to QVariant to ensure any Python object can be
converted (and to a C++ instance where possible).  (I will probably take this a
little further.)


2008/09/03  9:37:59  phil
QVariant() and QVariant.toPyObject() will now handle non-Qt wrapped types
properly.


2008/09/02 14:42:33  phil

2008/08/24 19:12:58  phil
pyuic will now complain if it finds a custom widget header file name that
contains '..'.


2008/08/24 18:23:04  phil
Added %MethodCode for QKeySequence::operator[] to do bounds checking so that
iterating over an instance works properly.  Also added Pythonic handling of
negative indices.
Reviewed all other operator[] implementations and adopted the same code
skeleton.


2008/08/08 15:06:03  phil
Released as v4.4.3.


2008/08/07  9:30:41  phil
Added the missing /Transfer/ annotations to the setVerticalHeader() and
setHorizontalHeader() methods of QTableView.


2008/08/04 14:41:28  phil
Fixed the problems with the old documentation system by removing the dependency
on ElementTidy.


2008/08/03 17:45:28  phil
The new documentation system now generates the main index page.


2008/08/03 11:44:43  phil
Implemented the WebXML parsing infrastructure.

2008/07/23 13:45:10  phil
Applied a patch from Giovanni Bajo (submitted over a year ago!) for handling
UTF-8 Python source containing UTF-8 literal strings.


2008/07/22 16:23:04  phil
Fixed a pyuic bug handling the widget of a QScrollArea.


2008/07/05 18:44:30  phil
Fixed a bug in pyuic that was triggered by layouts with items appearing before
widgets with items.


2008/06/27 18:50:54  phil
A QChar can now be used whenever a QString is expected.
Removed a number of methods (mostly in QString) that are now redundant.
Reordered a couple of other methods to make sure the QChar version takes
precedence where the underlying C++ code doesn't simply treat the QChar as a
QString of length one.


2008/06/27 15:00:50  phil
All read related methods that take a maximim read length will now raise an
exception if the length is negative.


2008/06/23 11:41:30  phil
Fixed a pyuic bug where the icon cache wasn't handling icons with no roles
defined.


2008/06/23  9:19:46  phil
Fixed a pyuic bug handling strings containing double quotes.


2008/06/20 23:02:46  phil

Fixes to the GPL installer so that it will update PATH properly on uninstall
for the current user.


2008/06/12 13:31:54  phil
Fixed a number of __delitem__ bugs propagated by cut & paste.


2008/06/11 22:45:38  phil
The Windows installer now tries to update PATH for all users then tries for the
current user if that fails.  Everything is now stored in the PyQt4 directory in
site-packages.
Fixed the internal build system to use a local Python interpreter to create the
documentation because Ubuntu's elementtidy is broken.


2008/06/11 14:37:12  phil
pyuic no longer passes the QDockWidget as the parent of the widget being placed
in the dock (to be consistent with uic).


2008/06/10 18:11:35  phil
Fixed a regression in the QList conversion code for lists of ints and doubles.


2008/06/07 19:27:26  phil

2008/06/01 13:08:20  phil
Some minor fixes to the dragdroprobot.py example.


2008/06/01 13:02:13  phil
Replaced the QVariant ctor that took a QVariantList argument with the
fromList() static method.
Replaced the QVariant ctor that took a QVariantMap argument with the fromMap()
static method.
The above changes ensure that an empty Python list and dictionary will always
be handled as a Python object.


2008/05/31 23:41:28  phil
Went through the pyuic support for list, table and tree widgets to make sure
they match the current uic behaviour.
Added an icon cache to pyuic so that icons are only created once if they are
used in several places.


2008/05/30 19:22:03  phil
The QVariant ctor that takes a QStringList is not constrained.
Ensured that the QVariant ctor that takes a Python object moves on to the next
signature if it finds it has a wrapped type.


2008/05/29 21:27:44  phil
Added the embeddeddialogs.py and padnavigator.py examples from Igor
Prischepoff.

of Python v2.4.x and earlier that are built with a shared Python library.


2008/05/13 11:04:32  phil
Released as v4.4.


2008/05/13  9:29:43  phil

Added the SIP developers tools to the GPL installer.


2008/05/12 17:39:55  phil
Hacked at qtdemo.py so that it uses QtHelp (because QAssistantClient is broken
in Qt v4.4.0).
Updated the GPL installer now that we aren't going to bundle Qt or 3rd party
tools.


2008/05/11 16:27:39  phil

2008/05/07 22:12:11  phil
The meta-type support code now uses the new SIP generated assignment helpers
rather than trying to use the meta-type load and save support (which isn't
available for QScriptValue).

Some updates for the Windows installers.


2008/05/05 12:02:29  phil

2008/04/27 15:17:49  phil
The QVariant() ctor that takes a Python object now automatically registers the

QVariant.toPyObject() now returns NotImplemented when it can't convert (instead
of raising an exception).
Implemented QMetaType.type() (and others) and overloaded it to handle a Python
type object.


2008/04/24 16:46:40  phil
Added support for QVariant containing a Python object via a new ctor and the

Wrapped the remaining Phonon classes.


2008/04/16 20:16:37  phil

Changed the implementation of qt_metacast() to be consistent with qt_metacall()
etc.


2008/01/30 21:35:45  phil
Upped the SIP minimum version as the qt_metacast() support is needed.


2008/01/30 21:26:42  phil

Fixed a problem with the change to QDateTime pickling.


2007/12/24 17:12:56  phil
A pickled QDateTime now saves the time spec. This means that old versions of

Added __repr__ support to QByteArray, QChar, QDate, QDateTime, QLatin1Char,
QLatin1String, QLine, QLineF, QPoint, QPointF, QRect, QRectF, QRegExp, QSize,
QSizeF, QString, QTime, QUrl and QUuid (based on Giovanni's patch).

Added the test case for virtual operators.


2007/12/04 18:10:29  phil
Backed out the recent change that disabled the input hook for Windows2000.  It
turns out the cause of the problem was a conflict (bug?) with PyReadline.


2007/11/30 18:29:25  phil
Hid an internal configuration option.


2007/11/29 17:35:46  phil

2007/11/16 19:41:25  phil
Completely reimplemented the fix for leaking universal slots when the emitter
is not known (ie. QTimer.singleShot()) using the new SIP /SingleShot/ argument
annotation. (SIP v4.7.2 is now required.) The previous fix had problems when

Added the test script that shows a leaking QTimer.singleShot().


2007/11/08  9:48:06  phil
Added the --confirm-license option to configure.py.
Added the test_gc_thread.py test.


2007/10/28 11:35:32  phil
Changed the installers so that msvcp71.dll is installed if needed.


2007/10/28 10:51:13  phil
Universal proxy slots will now be reused when repeatedly connected to the same
Python slot so as not to leak memory in long running code.  The use case is
calling QTimer.singleShot() in a loop.


2007/10/18 10:14:52  phil
Fixed the ownership annotations on all createEditor() methods.


2007/10/16 17:53:30  phil

2007/10/14 16:20:47  phil
Updated the internal build docs now that Qt GPL for Windows supports MSVC.NET.
Changed the GPL license to be the same as Trolltech's exceptions.


2007/10/13 18:11:00  phil

Added the new TransferThis function annotation to QObject.deleteLater().


2007/10/03 13:51:15  phil
Switched to Qt v4.3.2.


2007/09/28 17:06:20  phil
Released as v4.3.1.

Some slight refactoring of the signal/slot proxy code in anticipation of making
the searching of proxies much faster.


2007/09/13 18:55:21  phil
New version of sandbox.pyw from Mark.
pyuic4 fix from Ulli for a problem with (for example) QScintilla.


2007/09/05 11:03:20  phil
Updated sandbox.pyw from Mark.
The locker classes now unconditionally release the lock in the __exit__()
method.  This avoids a potential deadlock when the 'as' clause is used in a
'with' statement.


2007/09/01 12:32:07  phil
The PyQtProxy mutex is now allocated on the heap as part of the module
initialisation to ensure that Qt's static initialisation is complete
beforehand.

Updated sandbox.pyw from Mark.


2007/08/29  9:30:57  phil

Updated sandbox from Mark.


2007/08/26 17:09:47  phil
A QGraphicsScene instance is now guaranteed to be destroyed before the
QApplication instance.  This should avoid apparently random crashes when an
application that has parentless QGraphicsScene instances terminates.


2007/08/26 12:33:13  phil
The input hook now checks if the current thread is the one in which the
application object was created.
Added sandbox.pyw from Mark Summerfield to the contrib directory.


2007/08/16 17:07:24  phil
Fixed the ordering of the QKeySequence ctors and removed a couple that have
been superceded by QKeySequence convertor code.


2007/08/13 21:56:33  phil
Explicitly pass the dest argument to all calls to add_option() in configure.py.
(It looks like it might be needed for old versions of Python, ie v2.3.x.)


2007/08/11 19:15:45  phil
Change to pyuic to treat property names correctly irrespective of the current
locale.


2007/08/10 12:23:47  phil

Updated the NEWS file.


2007/07/27 17:40:09  phil
Fixed QTextEdit.print() to be print_() from Python.
Building static plugins (when Qt has been built as shared libraries) is now
disabled with a warning message rather than being treated as an error.
Added quotes if needed to the Designer Python plugin .pro file.
Added the --no-sip-files options to configure.py to disable the installation of
the .sip files.
Fixed a bug in universal proxy handling that didn't account for disable()
legitmately being called twice.


2007/07/23 22:29:23  phil
More PyQwt fixes to pick up the correct __init__.py.

The mega Windows GPL package now supports SSL.
The mega Windows GPL package no longer contains the Qt docs.


2007/07/21 10:22:12  phil
Changed the checking of the Qt layout in configure.py to work around Debian's
broken Qt build meaning that it failed to say that Qt was built as shared
libraries.

A further refinement to the signal/slot handling fix.


2007/07/17 21:52:14  phil

Fixed a bug in signal/slot handling where proxies where being incorrectly
reused when the original transmitter had been deleted, but a new one had been
created at the same address before the proxy had itself been deleted.


2007/07/14 16:37:42  phil
Improvements in configure.py error messages for Windows from Giovanni.


2007/07/10 21:51:06  phil

Improved the detection of a static Qt build.
Disabled the QtDesigner module with a static Qt build.

Dale.


2007/06/12 18:15:00  phil
Added some extra %ModuleHeaderCode for #include files that were previously
being picked up by accident.  (SIP v4.7 is a little bit more picky about this.)


2007/06/06 21:54:15  phil
Fixed a Qt 4.3 related pyuic problem with QLayout.setContentsMargins().


2007/06/01  9:03:22  phil
Removed the /TransferBack/ annotations on QLayout.removeWidget(),
QStackedWidget.removeWidget(), QStatusBar.removeWidget() and
QTabWidget.removeTab() because QLayout.removeWidget() does not reparent the
widget being removed so it is still owned by C++.


2007/05/30 22:40:18  phil

Fixed a configure.py bug that was preventing the Qt module being built and
installed.


2007/05/24 19:45:50  phil

returned objects.


2007/05/19  0:38:11  phil

types).
Updated the installation documentation regarding the -d flag to configure.py.

Added DavidB's Designer plugin examples.


2007/02/18 17:10:09  phil
The proxies for signals are no longer children of the transmitter but are
connected to the destroyed() signal (just like slots).  This means they will
hang around longer if they are proxying for the destroyed() signal itself.


2007/02/18 12:37:19  phil
Made some attempt to check that the Python library is dynamic before building
the Designer plugin.


2007/02/18 11:28:52  phil
Make sure the Python object returned by a property getter is kept until the
next get so that we are sure that there is always a valid pointer.


2007/02/18 10:01:14  phil
The Designer plugin now ignores the QPyDesignerCustomWidgetPlugin type object

Designer plugins in Python - but not yet documented or ported to Windows and
Mac.


2007/02/12 21:30:46  phil
More work on the Designer plugin.  Plugins are correctly imported but their

Included the (probably temporary) setData() and setSuper() methods to
QMetaObject.


2007/01/23 23:42:36  phil
Added support for qt_metacall().  This is a significant part of the support for
plugins implemented in Python.  This compile, but is otherwise untested.

Another pylupdate update from Detlev.


2007/01/21 16:28:25  phil

Completed the implementation of the dbus support module.


2006/12/22 18:21:32  phil

Added the len, [] and in operators to QStringList.


2000/10/01 12:37:31  phil
Backed out the changes to the examples as they are no longer needed now that
SIP allows slots to be called with more arguments than expected.  This means
that the breakage described in the previous ChangeLog entry has now been
repaired.


2000/10/01 00:50:32  phil
Added the missing QMenuData.setItemParameter(), QMenuData.itemParameter() and
QMenuData.activateItemAt().
QMenuData.insertItem() and QAccel.connectItem() now expect slots that will take
an argument.  THIS WILL BREAK SCRIPTS - but is the correct behaviour because
PyQt doesn't support the Qt feature of a slot consuming fewer arguments than a
signal provides.


2000/09/28 23:09:51  phil
Added the missing /TransferThis/ in the QWorkspace ctor.


2000/09/28 16:31:19  phil
