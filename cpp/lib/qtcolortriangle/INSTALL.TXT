INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

These instructions refer to the package you are installing as
some-package.tar.gz or some-package.zip. The .zip file is intended for use
on Windows.

The directory you choose for the installation will be referred to as
your-install-dir.


Unpacking and installation
--------------------------

1.  Unpack the archive if you have not done so already.

    On Unix and Mac OS X (in a terminal window):

	cd your-install-dir
	gunzip some-package.tar.gz
	tar xvf some-package.tar

    This creates the subdirectory some-package containing the files.

    On Windows:

    Either use WinZip to extract the .zip archive or use the infozip tools
    you can download under

	ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/util/infozip.exe

    If you are using the infozip tools (in a command prompt window):

	cd your-install-dir
	unzip some-package.zip

2.  Enter the package directory and configure the package:

	cd some-package
	qmake

    The qmake command will prompt you in some cases for further
    information. Answer these questions and carefully read the license text
    before accepting the license conditions. The package can't be used if
    you don't accept the license conditions.

3.  To build the examples (for Qt Solutions components) or the application
    (for Qt Solutions tools):

	make

    Or if you are using Microsoft Visual Studio:

	nmake

    The example programs are located in the example or examples
    subdirectory.


Using a component in your project
---------------------------------

The directory your-install-dir/src includes all the source code for the
component. To use this component in your project:

1.  Add the following line

	include(your-install-dir/src/some-package.pri)

    to the project's .pro file.

2.  Run qmake on the project's .pro file.

This adds the package's sources and headers to the SOURCES and HEADERS
qmake variables respectively, and update INCLUDEPATH to contain the
package's src directory. Additionally, the .pri file may include some
dependencies needed by the package.

To include a header file from the package in your sources, you can now
simply use:

    #include <some-package.h>


Install documentation
---------------------

The HTML documentation for the package's classes is located in the
your-install-dir/doc/html/index.html. You can open this file with any web
browser.

To install the documentation into Qt Assistant:

1.  The directory your-install-dir/doc/html contains a file with the
    extension .dcf. The name of this file may vary. In the following
    description we refer to this file as index.dcf.

2.  Close any running instances of assistant.

3.  Execute the following commands in a shell, command prompt or terminal
    window:

	cd your-install-dir/some-package/doc/html/
	assistant -addContentFile index.dcf

The next time you start Qt Assistant, you can access the package's
documentation.


Remove the documentation from assistant
---------------------------------------

1.  The directory your-install-dir/doc/html contains a file with the
    extension .dcf. The name of this file may vary. In the following
    description we refer to this file as index.dcf.

2.  Close any running instances of assistant.

3.  Execute the following commands in a shell, command prompt or terminal
    window:

	cd your-install-dir/some-package/doc/html/
	assistant -removeContentFile index.dcf
